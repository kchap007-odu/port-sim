// * Move cargo from ship to warehouse.
// * Move cargo out of warehouse.

-------------------------------REFINEMENT 2-------------------------------------
// * Ship arrives at queue.
// ** Generate a random number between 0 and 3.
// ** Add number of ships arriving to the number currently in the queue.
// * Dock ship.
// ** If there is at least one ship in the queue, look for an open pier and dock.
// * Move cargo from ship to warehouse.
// ** Iterate through all piers.
// ** Determine the amount of cargo to move from ship to warehouse.
// * Move cargo from warehouse to destination.
// ** Iterate through all piers.
// ** Subtract WAREHOUSE_UNLOAD_RATE from cargo in warehouse.

// * Ship arrives at queue.
// ** Generate a random number between 0 and 3.
// ** Add number of ships arriving to the number currently in the queue.
// *** If the maximum queue size is met, ignore the incoming ships.
// * Dock ship.
// ** Iterate through each pier until an open one is found, if found, assign cargo to port.
// *** If there is at least one ship in the queue, look for an open pier and dock.
// * Move cargo from ship to warehouse.
